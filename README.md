# studio

* a simple comic strip creator for browsers, made for desktop/mobile devices
* implemented [here](https://egar.fr/studio.html)
* the version available here lacks some image resources because i dont know how to import everything at once and creating folders is painfully slow

## get started / prerequisites

* download the html, css, and js files
* use your preferred code editor

not much else to it i think

## contributing

* i don't know how github works, you probably do
* feel free to make changes and fix anything i did incorrectly

## author

## license

## acknowledgments

* this was inspired by the work done in the [historic tale construction kit](https://htck.github.io/bayeux/#!/)
* whoever made the js libraries i used has contributed more to this project than i have
